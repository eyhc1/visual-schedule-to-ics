# Visual Schedule to ics
 Export your UW Visual Schedule to an ics file that you could import into your calendar app such as Google Calendar or Outlook
## Use
 You can either run the run.bat file, or if you do not want to enter the netID and password everytime you can just edit it in the .py file and run it from there
## Known Issues
 - You can't use Shadowsock or similar VPN survices while running the program due (maybe) to SSL issues
 - program will load infinitely if you run with getpass() in PyCharm as you type in your accounts
